## Term/Phrase
Public Identity Utility

## Definition
A distinct system of domain specific ledgers operated by decentralized peer nodes and associated with a DID Namespace. Preferably built on Hyperledger Indy, this DID Ledger, is governed by an independent governing body and its own governance framework. Due to the overuse of terms such as "Network" and "Ledger", the term "Utility" has been accepted by the Bedrock Consortium to allow for additional clarity. See also Backbone Network.

## Usage example
The Bedrock Business Utility is one of many possible Public Identity Utilites that leverage Hyerledger Indy.
