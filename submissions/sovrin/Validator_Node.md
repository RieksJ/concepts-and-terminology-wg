## Term/Phrase
Validator Node

## Definition
A Node that validates new Transactions and writes valid Transactions to the Sovrin Ledger using the Sovrin Consensus Protocol. A Node may be able to operate as either a Validator Node or an Observer Node, but at any one point in time it must operate in only one of these two roles. A Steward may run only one Validator Node on the Sovrin Main Network.
