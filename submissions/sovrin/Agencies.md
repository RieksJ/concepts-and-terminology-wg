## Term/Phrase
Agencies

## Definition
While Edge Agents by definition do not require external hosting, Cloud Agents do&mdash;either self-hosting by an Identity Owner or third-party hosting by a service provider called an Agency. Sovrin Agencies are a new class of service provider comparable in many ways to ISPs (Internet service providers), email service providers, or Web service providers.The key difference, however, is that Agencies implementing the Sovrin Governance Framework need to meet the Security by Design, Privacy by Design, and Data Protection by Design Principles of the SGF. This is a much higher bar than standard cloud hosting, and a major goal of the SGF is to incent a &ldquo;race to the top&rdquo; of Agency providers competing in the market to provide the strongest possible security, privacy, and data protection assurances.
