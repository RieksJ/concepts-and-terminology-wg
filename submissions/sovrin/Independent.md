## Term/Phrase
Independent

## Definition
An Individual who directly controls the Private Key(s) and Link Secret(s) required to administer a set of Sovrin Identity Data and thus is not dependent on any other party for control (other than the Developer of the software and/or hardware for an Agent or Wallet used by that Individual). For any particular set of Sovrin Identity Data, this definition is mutually exclusive with Dependent. Note that it is possible for the same Identity Owner to be both an Independent for some Sovrin Identities and a Dependent for others.
