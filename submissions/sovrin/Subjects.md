## Term/Phrase
Subjects

## Definition
Although &ldquo;Subject&rdquo; does not appear directly in Figure G.1, it is easy to define: it is the Entity that a DID identifies and a Credential describes. For example, the Subject of a passport or driving license is the Individual to whom it was issued. The Subject of a certificate of incorporation is the Organization to whom it was issued. The Subject of a certificate of authenticity is the Thing for which it was issued, e.g., a particular diamond, painting, or sculpture.It is important to note that the Subject of a Credential is not always the Holder/Prover of the Credential. For example, while the primary Subject of a birth certificate is a baby, the actual birth certificate will typically be issued to both the mother and the father as Holders. When the child is old enough to have his/her own Wallet, another copy of the birth certificate can also be issued to the child as a Holder. Note that while the actual data on this birth certificate will be the same, the underlying cryptographic proofs will be different for each of the different Holders.Another common example of when the Subject is not the Holder is when a Credential is issued to a Credential Registry.
