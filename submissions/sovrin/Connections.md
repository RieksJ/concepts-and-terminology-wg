## Term/Phrase
Connections

## Definition
Connections are covered in Appendix A. They are the fundamental unit of relationship between two Sovrin Entities&mdash;and the basis for establishing the context of any private Sovrin Identity. Figure F illustrates that in Sovrin architecture, Connections can be of two common types:Edge-to-Edge Connections (green arrow) are where two Edge Agents communicate directly between two edge devices without using Cloud Agents or another other intermediary servers. This is required when two devices are offline, for example, if a law enforcement official needs to check a driving license in a remote area where there is no Internet.Cloud-to-Cloud Connections (blue arrows) are where the Connection goes through one or more Cloud Agents in order to support push messaging, message queuing, group messaging, or other Agent-to-Agent Protocol features.AgenciesWhile Edge Agents by definition do not require external hosting, Cloud Agents do&mdash;either self-hosting by an Identity Owner or third-party hosting by a service provider called an Agency. Sovrin Agencies are a new class of service provider comparable in many ways to ISPs (Internet service providers), email service providers, or Web service providers.The key difference, however, is that Agencies implementing the Sovrin Governance Framework need to meet the Security by Design, Privacy by Design, and Data Protection by Design Principles of the SGF. This is a much higher bar than standard cloud hosting, and a major goal of the SGF is to incent a &ldquo;race to the top&rdquo; of Agency providers competing in the market to provide the strongest possible security, privacy, and data protection assurances.
