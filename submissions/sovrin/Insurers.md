## Term/Phrase
Insurers

## Definition
The Sovrin Governance Framework defines one more role that could play an increasingly important part in SSI infrastructure as it matures. This role&mdash;Insurer&mdash;is illustrated in Figure G.2.Figure G.2: The Role of an Insurer in SSI infrastructureThe &ldquo;trust triangle&rdquo; formed between an Issuer, Holder/Prover, and Verifier provides a way for Issuers to convey trust (in the form of a Credential) to Holders, and for Holders to convey that trust (in the form of a Proof) to a Verifier. But the higher the level of trust assurance sought by a Verifier&mdash; particularly if it is paying an Issuer for the value of a digital credential&mdash;the higher the motivation of an Issuer to mitigate the risk of an error through the purchase of insurance from an Insurer.For more about the role of insurance in Self-Sovereign Identity infrastructure, see this article by Vinay Gupta.
