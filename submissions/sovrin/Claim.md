## Term/Phrase
Claim

## Definition
An assertion about an Attribute of a Subject. Examples of a Claim include date of birth, height, government ID number, or postal address&mdash;all of which are possible Attributes of an Individual. A Credential is comprised of a set of Claims. (Note: In the first version of the Sovrin Trust Framework, this term was used the same way it was used in the early W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group specifications&mdash;as a synonym for what is now a Credential. That usage is now deprecated.)
