## Term/Phrase
Auditor Accreditors

## Definition
The final step up the trust scaling ladder&mdash;one especially appropriate for Trust Communities who need to operate at global scale&mdash;is for a Governance Authority to appoint one or more Auditor Accreditors. These are professional firms who specialize in developing audit criteria out of baseline requirements in Governance Frameworks and Trust Assurance Frameworks. They evaluate applicant Auditors for their competence, independence, and quality control measures and approve them to operate under a particular Trust Assurance Framework.Under some Governance Frameworks, Auditor Accreditors may also issue Credentials&mdash;directly to Trust Anchors and also to Credential Registries&mdash;once they receive a report from an approved Auditor.&copy; 2019 by Sovrin Foundation.
