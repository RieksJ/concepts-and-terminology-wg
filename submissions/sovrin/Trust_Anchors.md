## Term/Phrase
Trust Anchors

## Definition
The term &ldquo;trust anchor&rdquo; is derived from cryptography. The Wikipedia definition is:In cryptographic systems with hierarchical structure, a trust anchor is an authoritative entity for which trust is assumed and not derived.Relative to Sovrin Infrastructure, this means a Trust Anchor is defined in the Sovrin Glossary as:An Issuer who is considered by a Verifier or a Governance Authority to be authoritative for a particular set of Claims or Credentials. In other words, when a Verifier is making a Proof Request, what the Verifier is seeking is a set of Claims that it can verify came from a Trust Anchor. A common example is a university diploma: in many cases, a Verifier will only accept Proof of a diploma if the Issuer of the Credential is the university itself.So establishing the Trust Anchors for a Trust Community is usually the very first step to building trust in its Credentials. As mentioned above, this step does not necessarily require establishing a Governance Authority and publishing a Governance Framework first&mdash;particularly if the natural Trust Anchors in the community are already well known. However if a Governance Framework is developed, one of its natural functions is to either: a) designate the Trust Anchors directly (using a list of Anywise DIDs), or b) specify the criteria by which Trust Anchors are Accredited and listed in a Credential Registry.
