## Term/Phrase
The Credential Exchange Layer

## Definition
Taken together, the Sovrin Ledger layer and the Agent-to-Agent Protocol layer only establish Cryptographic Trust&mdash;trust that a set of machines (Man-Made Things) operating cryptographic algorithms will behave as expected. It does not establish Human Trust&mdash;trust that a set of people (Individuals and/or Organizations) will behave as expected. This is the job of the next two layers, starting with the Credential Exchange layer. This is the layer where Issuers issue Credentials (describing Subjects) to Holders (which may or may not be the Subject). Holders then act as Provers to present Proofs of those Credentials to Verifiers, who use the Sovrin Ledger to look up the Issuer&rsquo;s DID to get the Public Key needed to verify the Proof. Credential Exchange Layer Roles are described in more detail in Appendix G.
