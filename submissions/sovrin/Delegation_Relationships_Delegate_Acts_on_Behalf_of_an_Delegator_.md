## Term/Phrase
Delegation Relationships (Delegate Acts on Behalf of an Delegator)

## Definition
Delegation is perhaps the most common of all identity control relationships. People constantly delegate responsibilities to other people; organizational structures exist largely to define delegation relationships. The key to defining Delegation in the Sovrin ecosystem is that it exists only between two Independent Identity Owners who both have direct control of their Private Keys. If one Identity Owner does not control their Private Keys, it requires Guardianship; if one of the Entities is a Thing, it requires a Controller.[3]Since Delegation requires both Identity Owners to control their own Private Keys (and thus have their own Wallets and Agents), a Delegation relationship can be authorized using a special type of Credential called a Delegation Credential. A Delegation Credential is issued to the Delegate by the Delegator. As the Holder of the Delegation Credential, the Delegate can then use the Sovrin Protocol to show a Proof to a Verifier that the Delegate is authorized to act on behalf of the Delegator with regard to some specific responsibility or capability.[4]Common examples:A parent (Delegator) issuing a Delegation Credential to a babysitter (Delegate) to authorize him to approve medical treatment of a child in case of an emergency. A company (Delegator) issuing a Delegation Credential to an employee (Delegate) to authorize her to represent the company in a consortia or other external organization.A political party (Delegator) issuing a Delegation Credential to a party member (Delegate) to represent the party at a political convention or to vote on a ballot (e.g. the U.S. Electoral College).The legal responsibility of a Delegate depends on the relationship with the Delegator and the duties being delegated. In some cases it may be strictly informal, such as one friend delegating to another the ability to unlock his garage door to borrow his power tools. In other cases, such as medical or legal authorizations, the legal responsibilities may be defined by existing law. In still other cases the Delegation Credential may explicitly reference an associated legal agreement defining liability and other legal considerations.
