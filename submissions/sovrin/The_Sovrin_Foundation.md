## Term/Phrase
The Sovrin Foundation

## Definition
This is the non-profit public trust organization launched in September 2016 to establish Sovrin as a global public utility for self-sovereign identity. The Sovrin Foundation does not own or run the Sovrin Ledger&mdash;that is the collective job of the Sovrin Stewards (below). Rather, the job of the Foundation is to put in place the governance necessary for a decentralized network dedicated to SSI.The vehicle for that governance is the Sovrin Governance Framework, which is why the Sovrin Governance Framework Working Group was one of the first Sovrin Governing Bodies. There are now eight of them that manage all aspects of Sovrin governance&mdash;see Appendix A of the Sovrin Governance Framework Master Document for the complete list. As discussed in Appendix H, the Sovrin Foundation formally serves as the Governance Authority for the Sovrin Governance Framework.The Sovrin Foundation collectively represents all Identity Owners who use (or wish to use) the Sovrin Network. The Foundation itself is ultimately governed by a set of Sovrin Trustees&mdash; Individuals from around the world with backgrounds in digital identity, security, privacy, governance, and public policy. Sovrin Trustees each have their own public Sovrin Identities on the Sovrin Ledger so they may use their Private Keys to cryptographically approve the addition of other Sovrin Trustees or Stewards.
