## Term/Phrase
Sovrin Web of Trust Model

## Definition
The decentralized, non-hierarchical trust model defined by the Sovrin Governance Framework, the Sovrin Web of Trust Framework, and the Sovrin Stack. The Sovrin Web of Trust Model does not rely on a single root of trust, but empowers any Sovrin Entity to serve as a root of trust and enables all Sovrin Entities to participate in any number of interwoven Trust Communities, either informally or as defined by Domain-Specific Governance Frameworks.
