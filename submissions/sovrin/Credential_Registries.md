## Term/Phrase
Credential Registries

## Definition
Credential Registries are a new trust development mechanism that has grown out of W3C Verifiable Credentials architecture. The formal Sovrin Glossary definition of the term is:An Entity that serves as a Holder of Credentials issued by Trust Community Members in order to provide a cryptographically verifiable directory service to the Trust Community or to the public.In short, a Credential Registry is a Holder of Credentials that is not the Subject of those Credentials. The Subject of each Credential in the registry will be some other Trust Community Member. Credentials are issued to the Credential Registry in order to provide a third-party discovery and verification function&mdash;to make it easy for Trust Community Members to see and verify who has been issued Credentials for what.Credential Registries are most useful for Credentials containing publicly available information that avoids privacy and intellectual property issues, such as corporate registrations, business licenses, public health certificates, etc. Perhaps the best example is the OrgBook Credential Registry created using Hyperledger Indy and Sovrin by the Government of British Columbia as the start of the VON (Verifiable Organizations Network).Credential Registries enable any set of Issuers&mdash;especially a set of Trust Anchors&mdash;to issue Credentials to a common discovery point in order to establish a baseline of publicly verifiable information about a Trust Community&mdash;even without establishment of a formal Governance Framework. This new mechanism is poised to become a powerful new tool in the evolution of the Sovrin Web of Trust.
