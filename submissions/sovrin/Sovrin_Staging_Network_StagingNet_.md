## Term/Phrase
Sovrin Staging Network (StagingNet)

## Definition
A non-authoritative version of the Sovrin Ledger operated by Stewards for the purpose of demonstrating and verifying Sovrin-based solutions. Although it should run the same version of the Node software as the Sovrin Main Network, the Sovrin Staging Network is intended to remain relatively stable for long periods while the Sovrin Builder Network is used for active testing and may need to be frequently reset. The Sovrin Staging Network was previously known as the Sovrin TestNet.
