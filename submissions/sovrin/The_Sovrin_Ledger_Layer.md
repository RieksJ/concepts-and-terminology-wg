## Term/Phrase
The Sovrin Ledger Layer

## Definition
The bottom layer&mdash;literally the foundation of Sovrin Infrastructure&mdash;is the Sovrin Ledger layer where public Sovrin Identities are rooted in Anywise DIDs. As described in Appendix A, Sovrin Identities typically only need to be rooted at this layer by Issuers who need their Credentials to be publicly verifiable. The Sovrin Ledger also includes publicly available Schemas, Credential Definitions, and Revocation Registries. Sovrin Ledger Layer Roles are described in Appendix E.While the Sovrin Foundation governs one specific ledger&mdash;the Sovrin Ledger&mdash;at this layer, a generic version of Sovrin Infrastructure, called the SSI Stack, can run on top of any distributed ledger or blockchain that supports the three higher layers. This is the path to a globally interoperable SSI &ldquo;network of networks&rdquo; in which an Anywise DID can be rooted in any participating ledger, blockchain, or other decentralized network.
