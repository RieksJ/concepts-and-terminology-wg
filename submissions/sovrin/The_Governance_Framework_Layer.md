## Term/Phrase
The Governance Framework Layer

## Definition
Some Credentials are very narrow in scope&mdash;issued by a single Issuer and only accepted by that same Entity or a limited group of Entities acting as Verifiers. An example might be a coffee shop loyalty card. However many Credentials are intended for broader adoption&mdash;for example, birth certificates, passports, driving licenses, credit cards, diplomas, and vaccination records. These typically have multiple Issuers and any number&mdash;even a mass market&mdash;of Verifiers. Establishing Human Trust in these widely-used credentials requires developing business and legal agreements between Issuers&mdash;typically a group of Organizations such as credit unions, banks, stores, healthcare providers, universities, or governments. This is the job of Governance Frameworks. Governance Framework Layer Roles are described in more detail in Appendix H.
