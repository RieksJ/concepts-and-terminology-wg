## Term/Phrase
Anywise

## Definition
A non-reciprocal relationship rooted in the Identity of one party, where the other party is the public (a faceless &ldquo;other&rdquo; that can be instantiated without bound). For an Organization to issue publicly Verifiable Credentials, its Issuer DID must be on a public ledger such as the Sovrin Ledger. It is thus an Anywise DID&mdash;a DID to which any other Entity may refer without coordination. The term &ldquo;public DID&rdquo; is sometimes used as a casual synonym for &ldquo;Anywise DID&rdquo;. However, &ldquo;public DID&rdquo; is deprecated because it is ambiguous, i.e., it may refer to a DID that is world-visible but usable only in pairwise mode, or to a DID that is not published in a central location but nonetheless used in many contexts, or to a DID that is both publicly visible and used in Anywise mode. Compare N-wise and Pairwise.
