## Term/Phrase
Auditors

## Definition
Once a Governance Authority has defined a Governance Framework, the next step up the trust scaling/strengthening ladder is the inclusion of a Trust Assurance Framework for auditing compliance. This component of a Governance Framework specifies the criteria by which one or more Auditors can assess the conformance of Trust Anchors, Credential Registries, or other Trust Community Members (sometimes including the Governance Authority itself).The best example is the Sovrin Trust Assurance Framework, developed as a component of the Sovrin Governance Framework V2 in order to specify compliance criteria for Sovrin Stewards and for the Sovrin Foundation itself.Auditors are independent professionals trained in evaluating evidence provided by Trust Anchors or other Trust Community Members asserting that they are in compliance with audit criteria set forth by the Trust Assurance Framework and by independent Audit Accreditation Bodies. They issue reports attesting to their opinions which enables Governance Authorities (or their Delegates) to issue Trust Anchor Credentials and place them on Credential Registries.
