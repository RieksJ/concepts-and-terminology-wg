## Term/Phrase
Agents

## Definition
The concept of Agents is fundamental bedrock for Sovrin Infrastructure. The simplest way to put it is: every Sovrin Identity is represented by an Agent and every Agent represents a Sovrin Identity. It does not matter what kind of Sovrin Entity the Agent represents&mdash;an Identity Owner (Individual or Organization) or a Thing (Natural or Man-Made)&mdash;it always through an Agent that a Sovrin Entity forms a Connection and shares a Sovrin Identity. This makes sense because only Agents &ldquo;speak&rdquo; the Agent-to-Agent Protocol and can securely read from and write to Wallets.[7]Wallets are in fact the &ldquo;other side of the coin&rdquo; of Agents. The bond between the two is so strong that in Sovrin architecture, every Wallet is associated with an Agent and every Agent is associated with a Wallet. In fact Agents use a subset of the Agent-to-Agent Protocol called the DKMS Protocol to perform the different functions required for interoperable decentralized key management, e.g., key exchange, automated backup, offline recovery, social recovery, etc. See the DKMS Design and Architecture document for more details.As shown in Figure F, Agents come in two fundamental types distinguished primarily by their hosting environments. Edge Agents operate at the edge of the Sovrin Network, i.e., either on local devices controlled directly by Identity Owners or on &ldquo;edge servers&rdquo; that are behind firewalls and represent trusted endpoints within an internal network. By contrast, Cloud Agents operate in the cloud, which is typically outside of the direct control of Identity Owners and thus subject to the terms and conditions of a cloud service provider.The distinction between Edge and Cloud Agents is most important when it comes to key management. With Edge Agents, private keys are by definition stored &ldquo;at the edge&rdquo;, where in most cases they can enjoy the highest security because they are under the local control of the Identity Owner and no available via the open Internet. Cloud Agents, on the other hand, should store private keys and other cryptographic material in an HSM (Hardware Security Module) or other secure storage that is protected from unauthorized access (ideally even from the cloud service provider or hosting Agency).Other than these distinctions, however, the job of all Agents are the same: establish and use Connections,[8] send/receive Agent-to-Agent Protocol messages, and perform actions on behalf of the Entity the Agent represents. Because these parties need to trust that their Agents are acting exclusively on their behalf, it is critical that Agencies hosting Cloud Agents&mdash;and Developers building Agent software and hardware&mdash;be fully committed to the Purpose and Principles of the Sovrin Governance Framework. (A key job of the Sovrin Trust Assurance Framework is to provide a way for this conformance to be measured and attested.)
