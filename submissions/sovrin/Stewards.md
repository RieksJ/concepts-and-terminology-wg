## Term/Phrase
Stewards

## Definition
Stewards are trusted institutions from around the world&mdash;universities, financial institutions, healthcare providers, NGOs, governmental agencies, trust service providers, etc.&mdash;who want the benefits of Sovrin and are thus willing to commit the resources necessary to run a Node of the Sovrin Ledger. A major portion of the Sovrin Governance Framework is devoted to specifying the requirements for Stewards, including the business qualifications defined in the Sovrin Steward Business Policies and the technical requirements defined in the Sovrin Steward Technical Policies (both Controlled Documents&mdash;see Appendix A of the Sovrin Governance Framework Master Document).Once all qualifications are met and a Steward is approved by the Sovrin Board of Trustees, the Steward must execute the Sovrin Steward Agreement with the Sovrin Foundation to establish the formal legal relationship between the two parties. The Sovrin Governance Framework (including this Glossary) is an Annex to the Sovrin Steward Agreement.
