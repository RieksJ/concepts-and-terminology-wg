## Term/Phrase
Transaction Authors

## Definition
The Sovrin Ledger exists for the purpose of writing Transactions that enable the functions of the three higher layers of the Sovrin Infrastructure stack (see Appendix D). At present these include DIDs, Attributes, Schemas, Credential Definitions, Revocation Registry Definitions, and Revocation Registry Entries. A goal of the Sovrin Foundation is to enable any Sovrin Entity (Individual, Organization, Thing) that requires a public Sovrin Identity to be able to write these Transactions to the Sovrin Ledger. The Sovrin Entity acting in that role is called a Transaction Author.The vast majority of Transaction Authors are likely to be Organizations because they are the ones most likely to be Issuers who need their Credentials to be publicly verifiable. By contrast, most Individuals will not need to write to the Sovrin Ledger directly because the vast majority of their DIDs will be Pairwise Pseudonymous, i.e., shared privately in the context of a specific Connection (see Appendix A and Appendix F).However, in some cases Individuals may also need to be Transaction Authors because they need public Sovrin Identities&mdash;either for discoverability or to issue Credentials that can be publicly verified. And the same applies to certain classes of Things, especially those that play core roles in supply chains or IoT (Internet of Things) networks.[6]
