## Term/Phrase
Transaction Endorsers

## Definition
The right side of Figure E is labelled Public Write Access. This is the policy under which any Transaction Author will be able to write directly to the Sovrin Ledger without the use of any intermediary. As explained in the preamble to Sovrin Ledger Access Policies, Public Write Access has not been implemented yet due to regulatory uncertainties about the treatment of Personal Data. However it is a goal of the Sovrin Foundation, the Sovrin Governance Framework Working Group, and the Global Policy Working Group to clear up these uncertainties as soon as possible. Once that is done, and the necessary policies and source code have been developed and tested, Public Write Access will be implemented. This is not an easy task since it is these policies and this code that will protect the Sovrin Ledger from spam, Sybil attacks, and other malicious behavior that cannot be avoided when operating a global public utility.In the meantime, in order to start providing value as quickly as possible, the Sovrin Governance Framework defines policies for Permissioned Write Access. Under these policies, a Transaction Endorser&mdash;a Sovrin Entity who enters a legal agreement with the Sovrin Foundation (the Transaction Endorser Agreement)&mdash;is able to authorize a Transaction by digitally signing it so it will be accepted by a Validator Node. Note that the Transaction Endorser role is only needed for Permissioned Write Access. This role will not be needed for Public Write Access.
