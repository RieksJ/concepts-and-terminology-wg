## Term/Phrase
Developers

## Definition
Ultimately the security, privacy, and data protection capabilities of all Wallets and Agents&mdash;both Edge and Cloud&mdash;comes down to the capabilities of the software and hardware on which they are implemented. This is the role of Developers in the Sovrin ecosystem. As with Agencies, Developers must be motivated to implement code that conforms to the Sovrin Governance Framework and can be attested to under the Sovrin Trust Assurance Framework so that Identity Owners can be confident in the software and hardware they are running.Of course Developers are also responsible for the development of the Sovrin Open Source Code that is operated by Stewards in order to run their Nodes for the Sovrin Ledger. It is vital that this community of Developers also receive adequate rewards for maintaining this vital commons resource&mdash;this is one of the goals of the Sovrin Economic Policies.
