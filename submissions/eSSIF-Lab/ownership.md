## Term/Phrase
Ownership

## Definition
the rights and duties, as defined and enforced in that Jurisdiction, of that Entity to enjoy, dispose of, and control the other Entity.

## Short Description
**Ownership** is a relationship between two Entities in which one of these Entities (called the Owner) is entitled to enjoy, dispose of, and control the other Entity in an pretty much absolute (sovereign) fashion. Any ownership relationship is grounded in ((the rules of) the Legal system of) a specific Jurisdiction, that maintains and enforces these rules, and that has means to resolve any disputes arising from that. To do this, both Entities must be Legal entities in that Jurisdiction.

We may use the phrase Natural ownership to refer to an ownership relation that exists in the Jurisdiction 'Nature' (see the notes of Jurisdiction). This enables us to talk about things as 'the (natural) ownership of an Assertion'.

## Notes
- Owning something does not imply posessing it (and vice versa). For example, if you find a coin that doesn't belong to you, you possess it but do not own it. Also, its rightful owner obviously owns it, but doesn't possess it at that point in time.
