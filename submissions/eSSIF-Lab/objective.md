## Term/Phrase
Objective

## Definition
Something toward which a Party directs effort (an aim, goal, or end of action).

## Short Description
**Objectives** drive Parties as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the **mission** of that Party. A Party's objectives are part of its Knowledge. When made available to Agents of that Party, these agents can do the work that is needed to reach these goals (realize the Party's objectives).

## Examples
- generically: anything that, according to a Party c.q. its way of thinking, is important to be realized, qualifies as an Objective (and identifies its owner as that Party).
- most people have the objective 'stay alive'.
- the equivalent in organizations is 'continuation of its existence' (many operate 'business-continuity processes' to realize this, and to identify and mitigate any associated risks).
