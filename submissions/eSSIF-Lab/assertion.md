## Term/Phrase
Assertion

## Definition
a declaration/statement, made by a specific Party, that something is the case.

## Short Description
An **Assertion** is a declaration/statement that is made by one specific party (which we refer to as its owner). Such a statement may or may not reflect what that party holds or knows to be true - parties may lie.

The simplest kind of assertions come in the form ('subject', 'predicate', 'object'). For example, the triple ('John', 'is married to', 'Jill') says 'John is married to Jill'. Note that 'subject', 'predicate' and 'object' are all identifiers or other representations of the knowledge to the assertion's owner, and may not be dereferenceable in other contexts.
