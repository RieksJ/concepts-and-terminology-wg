## Term/Phrase
Governance

## Definition
the act or process of governing or overseeing the control and direction of something (Merriam-Webster).

## Short Description
**Governance** is the act (executed by, or behalf of some Party) or process (of some Party) of governing or overseeing the control and direction of something ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/governance)). The governance of a Party is embodied by the set of processes by which it decides how to make (other) decisions, how Actors that it Employs are to behave and operate, and ensure this guidance ends up in documents (which we will call Policies).

As Parties interact with one another, i.e. conduct Business transactions, they need to decide whether or not to commit to a transaction proposal. Deciding about how to make such a decision is one of the subjects of the governance process of that Party: it is establishing the kind of argument that may be used to make this decision.

Within eSSIF-Lab, governance is pretty much limited to the governance of various Policies.
