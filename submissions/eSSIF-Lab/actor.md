## Term/Phrase
Actor

## Definition
Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not Organizations.

## Short Description
An **Actor** is someone or something that can actually do things, such as people or machines. Actors will generally do things, i.e. execute Actions in different ways, depending on the context, or the Party for whom they do this.

## Examples
- People (human beings) obviously qualify, as do robots and other machines.
- Stones, pictures, ideas, etc. do not qualify.
- Software applications qualify, provided they are actually running on hardware. An app that is just sitting e.g. on a mobile phone but isn't executed does not qualify.
- Enterprises, governments, and other Organizations do not qualify.
