## Term/Phrase
Organization

## Definition
a group of people that work to realize one or more Objectives.

## Short Description
An **Organization** is a group of people that work to realize one or more objectives. Enterprises and governments are the prototypical examples. However, parts of enterprises (e.g. divisions, departments, business units) should also be considered organizations. This also holds for governments and governmental bodies.

## Examples
- Enterprises and governments are the prototypical examples.
- Parts of enterprises (e.g. divisions, departments, business units) and governmental bodies also qualify.
- Individual persons satisfy the criteria and hence qualify (see the Notes below). 

## Notes
- One may question whether or not a single person can be a 'group of people' (who would obviously work to realize its personal objectives) and hence qualify as an organization. The answer to this question is however irrelevant within our context, because we reason with the concept Party rather than the concepts organization and/or person.
