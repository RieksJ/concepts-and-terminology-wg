## Term/Phrase
Jurisdiction

## Definition
a Legal System (legislation, enforcement thereof, and conflict resolution) that is governed by a Party in a certain Scope.

## Short Description
A **Jurisdiction** is the composition of one Scope, one Legal system and one Party (called the Governor of the Jurisdiction) that operates the legal system within that scope. While most people are familiar with what we call Legal jurisdictions, please observe that Organizations habitually will have rules (business policies) in place, enforce them (to some extent), and have ways of resolving conflicts, and therefore qualify as a jurisdiction. Specifically, multi-national organizations are known to govern multiple jurisdictions, aliging the scopes with the scopes of other (often legal) jurisdictions for the purpose of preventing situations in which conflicting rules apply, which would lead to many effort-intensive conflict-resolution cases.

## Notes
The case can be made for Nature to qualify as a jurisdiction, postulating that this jurisdiction has a universal scope, its Party would be 'Nature' itself (which can be argued to qualify as a Party), and the Legal system that Nature operates are the 'laws of nature' (which Nature defines, enforces and settles disputes in). If one adopts this view, then people become (natural) Owners of e.g. Assertions, their Knowledge etc. Also, natural resources (e.g. rivers) would be Legal entities in that jurisdiction, since they are 'known, and recognized to exist' by Nature.
