## Term/Phrase
Identifier

## Definition
a character string that is being used for identification purposes.

## Short Description
An **Identifier** is a character string that is being used for identification purposes (by a specific Party).[^1] This includes names and labels, as they are (obviously) used for such purposes.

Note that while an identifier is used for identification purposes, this does NOT imply that the identifier actually identifies (singles out) anything.

--[^1]: This is the definition of [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-1.1) but without the requirement of complying with URI syntax constraints. Note that there is consensus in the literature about this. For example, [(Allen, 2016)](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html) defines ‘Identifier’ as “A name or other label that uniquely identifies an identity.”. [Pfitzmann and Hansen, 2010](https://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf) say (in footnote 57): “A name or another bit string”. The [DID-core specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) of W3C [defines ‘decentralized identifiers’ as specializations of URIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers).
