## Term/Phrase
Party

## Definition
an Entity that has Objectives, Knowledge about what exists, rules that (should) apply, and some capability that allows it to reason, make decisions, generate and maintain Knowledge etc. in a Self-Sovereign fashion.

## Short Description
A **party** is an Entity that pursues Objectives, and has his own, subjective, 'Self-Sovereign' Knowledge to help it realize these objectives. Perhaps one might also say: that have a mind of their own. Typical examples are individual people and Organizations. Their minds (subjective knowledge) are what distinguishes one Party from another, so every Party is 1-1 related to its knowledge (mind).

## Examples
People obviously qualify. Enterprises, governments, and other organizations also qualify as they can be seen as having their own knowledge (e.g. in their registrations, databases etc.), ways to reason with that knowledge (business rules, exercised by their employees or IT systems), and making decision.

Stones, pictures, ideas, etc. do not qualify. Also, electronic components do not qualify[^3].

## Background
The concept we know as 'party' serves a central role, and therefore occurs in various patterns, such as:
- The Parties, Actors and Actions pattern, which provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
- the Jurisdictions pattern, which shows that a Party can operate the Legal system of a Jurisdiction, enforcing the rules in some scopes to the (legal) entities that it knows to exist and to which these rules apply.

[^1]: Reasoning means: inferring conclusions from data, regardless of the kind of logic that is being used, or whether the reasoning is coherent, or consistent.

[^2]: This means that the Party can do this all by itself. For humans, the rights for this are laid down e.g. in the [ECHR](https://www.echr.coe.int "European Convention of Human Rights") ([ECHR articles 9-11](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf))

[^3]: While the case can be made that (some) electronic components can reason, they do not do so in a self-sovereign fashion as intended by this definition. We do not want to discuss AI-equipment here.
