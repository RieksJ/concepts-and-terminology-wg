# Curators

A curator is the liason between your group and the CTWG. Any group that is using the CTWG's terminology infrastructure should appoint one or more curators. The duties of a curator include:

* Work with the CTWG to configure a glossary.
* Train group members on glossary-related process.
* Help run the curation process for your group so the content of your glossaries meets your quality standards.
* Change the status of the github issues that your group uses to work on the glossary.

Curators are trained by the CTWG. They are welcome to attend CTWG meetings, but need not do so.
