# Concepts & Terminology Working Group

This is the home repo for the [Concepts &amp; Terminology Working Group (CTWG)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700).

It contains the corpus of concept and terminology data from which individual glossary deliverables are derived, and it is the host for github issues and PRs that modify and improve glossaries. If you're here to work on your glossary, you're in the right place.

### Common Tasks

* [Add one or more terms to a glossary](docs/add-terms.md)
* Browse or search a glossary
* Improve data about an existing term
* [Define a new glossary](../issues/new?assignees=&labels=glossary&template=new-glossary.md&title=%5BGLOSSARY%5D+%3Cnew+glossary+name%3E)
