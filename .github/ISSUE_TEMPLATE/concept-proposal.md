## Short Description
1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.

For example, the concept of a "mammal" in biology might be described as: "A warm-blooded animal, often having fur or hair, that produces milk to feed its young. Examples include rats, whales, and bats." A diagram could be included, if appropriate. The goal here is not perfect clarity; that's the focus of the next section.

## Scope of Definition
Identify the (single) scope within which the concept is to be defined. The scope you identify SHOULD have a Scope Description, or you should make one. `ToIP` is the 'universal' scope, `C&T` is the scope for discussions and topics in the ToIP Concepts & Terminology WG.

* (scope identifier)
