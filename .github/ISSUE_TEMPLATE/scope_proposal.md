## Governance
identify the organizational body that governs the scope, optionally refering to the governance framework/procedures.

Example: "[ToIP Concepts & Terminology WG](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700)".

## Objectives/Issues
State the issues, the identification and addressing is being considered and treated within the scope, and
the objectives, the realization of which is the reason for the scope's existence (note that a mission statement may be one of these objectives).

Examples:
* 'language confusion', evidence of which is that [many stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel#Comparable_myths) about this exist in various cultures, prevents people from different backgrounds to efficiently work together to create complex stuff.
* identify and address the issues that relate to ways of thinking (mental/conceptual models) and terminology that may be an impediment for the ToIP mission of constructing, maintaining and improving a globally working, pervasively used, scalable and interoperable infrastructure for the (international) exchange of verified and certified data.

## Scope identification
State a short text or abbreviation that can be used within ToIP to refer to the scope.
Optionally, a URI may be specified if global identification is required.
Scope identifiers/labels should be useable as prefix for terms.
