## What you want to change
>_What is the term/definition you want to change, and what glossary does it come from? (If you know how to hyperlink to items in the corpus, feel free to do that. More info about that is at https://github.com/dhh1128/ctwg/blob/master/docs/hyperlinks.md#links-from-issues. But if linking feels mysterious, a simple description will probably get us to the right place.)_

## Proposed change
>_What would make the data better?_

## Why
