## Language
This is a term in what language? Use ISO lang codes like "en", "de", etc.

## Labels concept
What concepts (definitions) does this term label? Ideally, each term labels one concept, but reality is often messier, so there could be more than one link here. For example, the term "agent" certainly labels more than one concept of interest to trust over IP.

## Variants
Acronyms, short forms, and similar derivations of the main term.

## Sample Usage
Quote from notable public documents where the term is used, using the html5 &lt;dfn&gt; tag to delimit the term. For example, here's how we might show sample usage of the term "mammal":

* [Australian Museum](https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/species-identification/ask-an-expert/what-is-a-mammal/): "<dfn>Mammals</dfn> are vertebrates with hair, mammary glands used to suckle young with milk, a diaphragm, three bones in the middle ear, and a lower jaw made up of a single pair of bones that articulates in a unique way with the skull."

## Status
proposed (could also be "preferred", "deprecated", "accepted")

## Notes
What should someone know who wants to use the term properly?

## Tags
Add hash tags here that allow us to group concepts in useful ways.
