## Scope of the Term
Identify the (single) scope within which the term is to be defined and used. The scope you identify SHOULD have a Scope Description, or you should make one. `ToIP` is the 'universal' scope, `C&T` is the scope for discussions and topics in the ToIP Concepts & Terminology WG.

* (scope identifier)

## Purpose
Describe why the term is needed. What purposes does it serve (e.g. the term is accepted/often used jargon in the scope)? If the term refers to a defined concept, then why is it different from the term that the concept definition specifies? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this concept relevant within its scope of definition?

## Language
This is a term in what language? Use ISO lang codes like "en", "de", etc.

## Labels concept
What concepts (definitions) does this term label within the scope for which it is defined? Ideally, each term labels one concept, but reality is often messier, so there could be more than one link here. For example, the term "verifier" may refer to a software component, but also to the organization that is responsible for using that. This section (alternatively: the Notes section) SHOULD provide the authoritative ways that are used in the scope for disambiguating such labels.

## Variants
Acronyms, short forms, and similar derivations of the main term.

## Sample Usage
Quote from notable public documents where the term is used, using the html5 &lt;dfn&gt; tag to delimit the term. For example, here's how we might show sample usage of the term "mammal":

* [Australian Museum](https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/species-identification/ask-an-expert/what-is-a-mammal/): "<dfn>Mammals</dfn> are vertebrates with hair, mammary glands used to suckle young with milk, a diaphragm, three bones in the middle ear, and a lower jaw made up of a single pair of bones that articulates in a unique way with the skull."

## Status
proposed (could also be "preferred", "deprecated", "accepted")

## Notes
What should someone know who wants to use the term properly?

## Tags
Add hash tags here that allow us to group concepts in useful ways.
